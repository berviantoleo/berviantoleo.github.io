        I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Institut Teknologi
        Bandung (ITB) or Institute of Technology Bandung in July 2018. I like to
        develop applications such as Mobile Applications and Web Applications. I
        always want to learn something new about technology. I also can develop
        another application like a native desktop application, etc. Feel free to
        contact me.
