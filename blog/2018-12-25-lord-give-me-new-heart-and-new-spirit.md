Thank you lord for this day! You want me to have new heart and new spirit! I never expected before, I think I will bored and just have a neutral feel about a Word of God in short day 22 until 24 December. No! God love you! God want you have new heart new spirit! Yes, I never expected as I say before. My heart, I think that I have closed to much so I can feel anything about Word of God.

Praise the Lord! God never leave you! In 22-25 December, I meet many young man and also each of The Body of Christ. Why many (!) here? I very enjoy with the meetings. There are many young man enjoy and praise the Lord with full of our strength, full of our soul, full of our mind.

I feel very enjoy when How We Should Love Him! God give us a heart to love Him! Oh Lord Jesus! Why in much time I give my time with another than You! I just know what is Love, but I looks like not love Him, maybe I looks like love Him but not really love Him. So pity I am. :(

You know, when you fall in love with someone, you will bring your time to her/him, right? Why you not give your time to your God? You must give time to Him! You have 24 hours in a day. I hope no one says "I'm not having a time". Oh Lord Jesus, from now we should back to the Lord, say we Love Him! We must bring time to Him. Young man have many times and many strengths to Love Him! Maybe we don't have many materials to be use for God's Work. But we have time!

I hope we all always enjoy him, keep our spirit, love Him with all of what we have. Praise The Lord!
